# Talking AI 🔊

## Overview
Talking AI is a sophisticated Chrome Extension designed to bridge the gap between static web content and interactive learning. Built with **React 19** and **TypeScript**, it leverages browser speech synthesis and LLM integration to allow users to listen to articles, explain complex jargon, and interact with text selections through a seamless, floating interface.

## Description
Reading long-form content can be exhausting. Talking AI provides a modern solution by transforming any webpage into an accessible audio experience. Whether you need a quick summary of a technical paragraph or want the entire page read aloud while you multi-task, this extension provides a high-performance, low-latency toolkit powered by AI. 🚀

## Features
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Instant natural voice synthesis for any selected text or full webpage.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Explanations:** Integration with OpenRouter to simplify complex topics into digestible language.
- 🖱️ **Contextual Floating UI:** An intuitive action button that appears exactly where you select text.
- ⚙️ **Deep Customization:** Adjust playback speed, select different voice profiles, and define custom AI system prompts.
- 🎨 **Modern Design:** A clean, accessible interface built with Tailwind CSS 4 and Radix UI primitives.
- 📄 **PDF Support:** Works seamlessly on both standard web pages and local PDF files opened in the browser.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project for development or to load it into your browser:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ddilibe/talking-ai.git
   cd talking-ai
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   Since this is a Chrome Extension, it must be compiled into a build directory.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Load into Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
   - Click **Load unpacked**.
   - Select the `build` folder generated in your project directory.

## Usage

### Using the Floating Control
1. Navigate to any website.
2. Highlight a sentence or paragraph.
3. A small floating speaker icon will appear near your cursor.
4. Click the icon to hear the text read aloud immediately.

### Using the Popup Menu
- Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.
- **Read Page Aloud:** Scans the document and begins sequential playback.
- **Explain Selection:** Uses the AI model configured in your settings to describe the highlighted text.
- **Settings:** Click the gear icon to enter your API key and customize the AI's "personality" or playback speed.

### Configuration
To enable AI explanations, you must provide an API key:
1. Open the extension **Settings**.
2. Paste your **Open Router API Key**.
3. Select your preferred model (e.g., GPT-4o or GPT-3.5-Turbo).
4. Save settings. Your key is stored locally and never leaves your browser environment.

## Extension Architecture
- **Content Scripts:** Injected into pages to handle DOM selection events and speech synthesis.
- **Popup UI:** A React application providing the primary interface.
- **Message Passing:** Uses `chrome.runtime` and `chrome.tabs` APIs to communicate between the UI and the active web page.
